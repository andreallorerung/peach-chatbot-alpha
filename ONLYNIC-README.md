# only-nic

This branch is the one most up to date with respect to the chatbot backend implementation.
These were changes made leading up to Niccolo Terreri's individual submission of this implementation
as part of the individual MSc Computer Science Project at UCL.

These were pushed to a secondary branch in order to not disrupt the azure-hosted webserver that 
pulls from this repository, as they were not checked against the rest of the system and may cause
issues where import statements may have changed.

This should be merged with the master branch before carrying on the project.

Please feel free to contact me for questions about carrying on the project or related issues,
my email is my first and last name separated by a dot at gmail.
The final dissertation report for this backend implementation can be found
